## FinRL-DRR task starter kit

### üß† Task Overview

This task is designed to test the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to generate accurate and context-aware responses related to regulatory and financial texts across three domains: **CDM (Common Domain Model)**, **MOF (Model Openness Framework)**, and **XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language)**.

#### üéØ Objective
Your primary goal is to fine-tune or train a model that can accurately interpret and respond to a variety of domain-specific questions. These questions span structured domains like financial product modeling, regulatory compliance, licensing standards, and financial reporting.

#### üí° What You Need To Do

1. **Collect and Prepare Your Raw Training Data**  
   Participants need to collect raw data given the source provided below. 

2. **Train or Fine-Tune Your LLM**  
   Use your collected data to fine-tune your own LLM or adapt an existing model for regulatory question answering.

3. **Submit Your Model**  
   Submit your trained model following the competition guidelines. Make sure your model is:
   - Capable of answering complex domain-specific questions.
   - Robust in interpreting structured data and reasoning over it.

4. **Benchmarking Phase**  
   After submission, we will use our standardized question sets to evaluate your model's performance on real-world regulatory QA tasks.
