SettlementTerms ensure that trades are executed and finalized according to agreed-upon terms.

They facilitate the automation of post-trade processes and reduce settlement risk."
What is BuyerSeller in product model of the common domain model,"BuyerSeller in the Product model of the CDM identifies the parties involved in a trade.

It assigns the roles of buyer and seller to the respective counterparties.

BuyerSeller information is essential for determining the flow of ownership and payment obligations.

The model ensures that these roles are consistently represented across transactions."
What is Financial Product in product model of the common domain model,"Financial Product in the Product model of the CDM is the highest-level abstraction representing tradable assets.

It encompasses all types of products, including derivatives, securities, and structured products.

Financial Product serves as the parent object for various specialized product types.

It provides a standardized structure for modeling diverse financial instruments.

"
What is Contractual Product in product model of the common domain model,"Contractual Product in the Product model of the CDM represents a subset of financial products with defined legal terms.

It captures pre-execution product characteristics that govern the behavior of the product.

Contractual Product is commonly used in derivatives and financing agreements.

It ensures that contract terms are accurately reflected and enforceable in trade processing."
What is Economic Terms in product model of the common domain model,"Economic Terms in the Product model of the CDM define the key economic parameters of a financial product.

They include attributes such as pricing mechanisms, payment schedules, and conditions.

Economic Terms ensure that the productâ€™s financial behavior is consistently modeled.

They provide the basis for valuation, risk analysis, and compliance processes."
