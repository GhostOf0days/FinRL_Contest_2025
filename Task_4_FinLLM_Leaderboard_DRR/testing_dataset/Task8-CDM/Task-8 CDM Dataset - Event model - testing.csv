Question,Answer
Please give me an explnantion of Event model of the common domain model,"The Event model of the Common Domain Model (CDM) defines the processes and states that occur throughout a trade's lifecycle.

It captures the sequence of business events, state transitions, and actions applied to financial products.

The Event model ensures that each event is tracked and represented consistently across different stages.

By standardizing events, the model enables seamless automation and reduces operational risks."
What is Trade State in event model of the common domain model,"Trade State in the Event model of the CDM represents the current status of a trade at any given point.

It captures information about the trade’s attributes, lifecycle events, and counterparties.

Trade State reflects changes caused by events such as amendments, terminations, and resets.

Accurate trade state management ensures that all actions are recorded and validated."
What is Trade in event model of the common domain model,
What is State in event model of the common domain model,"State in the Event model of the CDM defines the condition of a trade, product, or agreement after an event.

It tracks the changes resulting from operations such as resets, novations, and terminations.

State management ensures that all transitions are captured and documented in a consistent manner.

The Event model uses state information to determine the next applicable actions."
What is Reset in event model of the common domain model,"Reset in the Event model of the CDM modifies the attributes of a trade or product based on predefined conditions.

It is commonly used in derivative contracts to update reference rates, payments, and other terms.

Reset ensures that changes are applied according to the product’s contractual terms.

The Event model validates and records reset operations to maintain trade integrity."
What is Transfer in event model of the common domain model,"Transfer in the Event model of the CDM represents the movement of value or assets between parties.

It includes payments, settlements, and margin transfers.

Transfer ensures that all financial obligations are met according to the agreed terms.

The model captures and validates transfer events to ensure consistency."
What is Primitive Operator in event model of the common domain model,"Primitive Operator in the Event model of the CDM defines the fundamental actions applied to a trade or state.

These include operations such as creating, updating, and terminating a trade.

Primitive Operators form the basis for constructing more complex business events.

The model ensures that primitive operations comply with defined rules and conditions."
What is Primitive Function in event model of the common domain model,"Primitive Function in the Event model of the CDM specifies the functional logic that governs state changes.

It processes data inputs and generates outputs that reflect the modified state.

Primitive Functions enable automation of complex event sequences.

The model ensures that functions are executed consistently across all events."
What is Primitive Instruction in event model of the common domain model,"Primitive Instruction in the Event model of the CDM defines a specific command to apply a primitive operator.

It describes the conditions, parameters, and actions required to execute a change.

Primitive Instructions facilitate the systematic application of event logic.

They ensure that event outcomes align with predefined rules and constraints."
What is Primitive Composition in event model of the common domain model,"Primitive Composition in the Event model of the CDM combines multiple primitive operators to create a higher-level event.

It defines the order, dependencies, and relationships between operations.

Primitive Composition enables the creation of complex business events.

The model ensures that compositions follow a structured and repeatable pattern."
What is Business Event in event model of the common domain model,"Business Event in the Event model of the CDM describes a real-world occurrence that affects a trade or state.

It includes actions such as execution, amendment, termination, and settlement.

Business Events provide a structured framework for capturing operational changes.

The model ensures that all business events follow defined processes and logic."
What is Event Composition in event model of the common domain model,"Event Composition in the Event model of the CDM organizes multiple related events into a coherent sequence.

It defines the order, dependencies, and conditions governing event execution.

Event Composition supports complex workflows and multi-step processes.

The model ensures that composed events maintain consistency and logical flow."
What is Event Qualification in event model of the common domain model,"Event Qualification in the Event model of the CDM determines whether a proposed event is valid for execution.

It applies predefined rules and criteria to assess the event’s feasibility.

Event Qualification helps prevent invalid or redundant actions.

The model ensures that only qualified events proceed to execution."
What is Intent in event model of the common domain model,"Intent in the Event model of the CDM captures the purpose or objective behind an event.

It defines the desired outcome and guides the execution of related actions.

Intent is used to validate that event sequences align with business objectives.

The model ensures that intents are clearly defined and consistently applied."
What is Workflow in event model of the common domain model,"Workflow in the Event model of the CDM describes the sequence of steps required to execute a business process.

It defines the order, dependencies, and criteria for advancing through different stages.

Workflow management ensures that business processes are followed accurately.

The model supports flexible workflows that adapt to different trade scenarios."
What is Workflow Step Business Event in event model of the common domain model,"Workflow Step Business Event in the Event model of the CDM represents an individual step within a workflow.

It captures a specific action or change applied to a trade or state.

Workflow Steps ensure that each stage of a business process is recorded and validated.

The model provides a framework for tracking progress and resolving exceptions."
What is Proposed Event in event model of the common domain model,"Proposed Event in the Event model of the CDM identifies a potential change that has not yet been executed.

It includes the event’s intent, conditions, and expected outcomes.

Proposed Events undergo qualification before being applied to the trade state.

The model ensures that only valid proposals advance to execution."
What is Next Event in event model of the common domain model,"Next Event in the Event model of the CDM identifies the subsequent action required in a workflow.

It determines the logical progression of events based on the current state.

Next Event ensures that workflows proceed smoothly and without errors.

The model dynamically adjusts next events based on changing conditions."
What is Previous Workflow Step in event model of the common domain model,"Previous Workflow Step in the Event model of the CDM captures the last completed step in a workflow.

It records the details and outcomes of the preceding event.

Previous Workflow Steps provide context for determining subsequent actions.

The model maintains a historical record of all workflow activities."
What is Action in event model of the common domain model,"Action in the Event model of the CDM defines the specific task or operation performed within an event.

It describes the changes applied to the trade state and the conditions governing them.

Actions ensure that events are executed accurately and consistently.

The model validates and records actions to maintain trade integrity."
