## Introduction
Financial reinforcement learning FinRL [1,2] is an interdisciplinary field that applies reinforcement learning to financial tasks, such as portfolio management, algorithmic trading, and option pricing. The recent breakthroughs of large language models (LLMs) is driving open finance, which provides affordable and scalable solutions for customers to make intelligent decisions and created personalized financial search and robo-advisors. 

The FinRL Contest 2025 explores and evaluates the capability of machine learning methods in finance, with the following features: 

1. **FinRL-DeepSeek**. DeepSeek's groundbreaking open models have shown strong capabilities on par with popular close models. FinRL-DeepSeek [3] integrates financial reinforcement learning with large language models to enhance stock trading strategies. It adds risk assessment and trading recommendation signals generated by DeepSeek models from financial news. In this contest, we encourage participants to explore and innovate with FinRL-DeepSeek.
2. **AlphaSeek Using FinRL**. Factors play a critical role in driving trading decisions, enabling traders to design efficient, data-driven strategies. In FinRL Contest 2024, we set up two stages -- factor engineering and ensemble learning -- but only focused on the second stage and provided the factors directly. In this contest, we encourage participants to independently perform factor engineering and selection to create their trading strategies.
3. **Open FinLLM Leaderboard**. The [Open FinLLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/finosfoundation/Open-Financial-LLM-Leaderboard) [4] serves as an open platform to evaluate LLMs’ performance on various financial tasks. It encourages the community to explore the models’ capability and openness. In addition, complex financial regulations and industry standards are critical to the financial services, but the leaderboard haven’t included such benchmark datasets. We expanded and upgraded the regulations datasets developed during the [Regulations Challenge at COLING 2025](https://coling2025regulations.thefin.ai/home) [5]. In FinRL Contest 2025, we selected three domains for digital regulatory reporting: the Common Domain Model (CDM), the Model Openness Framework (MOF), and eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL). We aim to contribute these datasets to the leaderboard so that the participants can explore both existing tasks and the new regulatory reporting task. We also encourage participants to utilize reinforcement learning to develop their LLMs.

We design three tasks to promote open finance: **(1) FinRL-DeepSeek for Stock Trading**, **(2) AlphaSeek Using FinRL for Crypto Trading**, **(3) Open FinLLM Leaderboard – Make the Top**, and **(4) Open FinLLM Leaderboard – Digital Regulatory Reporting**. These challenges allow contestants to participate in various financial tasks and contribute to open finance using state-of-the-art technologies. We welcome students, researchers, and engineers who are passionate about finance and machine learning to partake in the contest.

## Data
For market data, we have more than 30 market data sources to deal with different financial tasks. We hold the data APIs and sample market environments in an open-source repository, [FinRL-Meta](https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinRL-Meta). Participants are welcome to explore and use in the FinRL Contest.

The [Open FinLLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/finosfoundation/Open-Financial-LLM-Leaderboard) contains 40 tasks in 7 categories, including information extraction, textual analysis, question answering, text generation, risk management, forecasting, and decision making. Participants are free to explore these benchmark datasets. 

For digital regulatory reporting, we expanded and upgraded the question datasets for Common Domain Model (CDM), Model Openness Framework (MOF), and eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) developed in the [Regulations Challenge at COLING 2025](https://coling2025regulations.thefin.ai/home). The question datasets will be released during the model evaluation phase.

## Environment
With a deep reinforcement learning approach, market datasets are processed into gym-style environments. The market environment provided to participants is designed to enhance both the realism and efficiency of the simulation process.

Table 1 lists the state spaces, action spaces, and reward functions of different FinRL applications. A state shows how an agent perceives a market situation. Facing a state, the agent can take an action from the action set, which may vary according to the financial tasks. Reward is an incentive mechanism for an agent to learn a better policy. Contestants will specify the state space, action space, and reward functions in the environment for both tasks.

Figure 1 shows the provided vectorized environment to support massively parallel simulataions. It manages multiple parallel sub-environments, each simulating different market scenarios and incorporating realistic market constraints.

## Tasks

Each team can choose to participate in one or more tasks. The prizes will be awarded for each task.

In addition, we will provide tutorials for participants to learn FinRL and the Open FinLLM Leaderboard.

### Task I: FinRL-DeepSeek for Stock Trading
TBA


### Task II: AlphaSeek Using FinRL for Crypto Trading
This task aims to develop robust and effective trading agents for cryptocurrencies through factor mining and ensemble learning. In this task, participants are expected to explore useful factors and ensemble methods for crypto trading. Participants are free to apply various techniques to the factor engineering process, design component models, and use innovative methods to increase the diversity of component models in the ensemble. They also need to specify the state space, action space and reward function in the environment. The final model should be able to interact with the provided trading environment.

#### Dataset
We provide second-level Limit Order Book (LOB) data for Bitcoin. Participants are permitted to use additional external datasets.

#### Model Evaluation
The performance of the model will be assessed by the following metrics:

1. Cumulative return. It is the total return generated by the trading strategy over a trading period.
2. Sharpe ratio. It takes into account both the returns of the portfolio and the level of risk.
3. Max drawdown. It is the portfolio’s largest percentage drop from a peak to a trough in a certain time period, which provides a measure of downside risk.

#### Submission
Participants need to submit a well-organized repository containing all scripts, models, and any custom libraries used to implement the solution. Each team should also submit a short paper (maximum of 4 pages) with the IEEE template. The title should start with “FinRL Contest 2025 Task 2.”

### Task III: Open FinLLM Leaderboard – Make the Top
This task aims to encourage the community to learn, maintain, and update the Open FinLLM Leaderboard – add new models (rows) to the leaderboard. In this task, participants are expected to submit their models and compete for high rankings in the leaderboard. Participants are free to train or fine-tune their models, which will be evaluated across all tasks in the leaderboard. We encourage participants to explore reinforcement learning techniques to enhance LLMs’ capabilities in financial tasks.

#### Dataset
The public benchmark datasets are described at the [leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/finosfoundation/Open-Financial-LLM-Leaderboard). Participants can collect the data themselves to train or fine-tune their models.

#### Model Evaluation
The final score of the model is the average score of all tasks. The metrics are specified by the leaderboard. 

#### Submission
Participants need to submit:
* The model that can be easily loaded.
* Scripts that load and inference with the model.
* Evaluation results for all tasks.

Each team should also submit a short paper (maximum of 4 pages) with the IEEE template. The title should start with “FinRL Contest 2025 Task 3.”

### Task IV: Open FinLLM Leaderboard – Digital Regulatory Reporting
This task aims to challenge the community to explore the strengths and limitations of LLMs in digital regulatory reporting and contribute the new task to the Open FinLLM Leaderboard – add new datasets (columns) to the leaderboard. Participants are expected to train or fine-tune their LLMs to perform tasks in the three domains: the CDM, the MOF, and XBRL:
* **CDM** is a machine-oriented model for managing the lifecycle of financial products and transactions. 
* **XBRL** is a standard for electronic communication of business and financial data but often has a high error rate in the filing process.
* **MOF** evaluates and classifies the completeness and openness of machine learning models. 


#### Dataset
We developed and upgraded the question datasets for the three domains. We will provide the data sources so that participants can collect data themselves. The full question datasets will be released during the evaluation period.

#### Model Evaluation
The model evaluation is the average score of all tasks. The metrics include:
* Accuracy: mainly used for questions that require specific answers, such as full expansions of abbreviations, yes-or-no questions, and financial formulas.
* FactScore: mainly used for Q&A questions, such as CDM documentation, MOF detailed Q&A and XBRL term explanation.
Details are specified in the data page.

#### Submission
Participants need to submit:
* The model that can be easily loaded.
* Scripts that load and inference with the model.

Each team should also submit a short paper (maximum of 4 pages) with the IEEE template. The title should start with “FinRL Contest 2025 Task 4.”


## Evaluation
For each task, the final ranking of participants will be determined by a weighted combination of model evaluation and paper assessment, with weights of 60% and 40% respectively.

**Model evaluation**:
* Task 1: TBD.
* Task 2: the geometric mean of the rankings of cumulative return, Sharpe ratio, and Max drawdown.
* Task 3: average score of all tasks.
* Task 4: average score across 3 tasks.

**Paper assessment**:
The participating teams will submit a short paper (maximum of 4 pages) for their solution with the IEEE template. The title should start with “FinRL Contest 2025 Task 1/2/3/4.”

The reviewing process is single-blind, using Open Review. The assessment of the paper will be conducted by invited experts and professionals. The judges will independently rate the data and model analysis, results and discussion, robustness and generalizability, innovation and creativity, organization and readability, each accounting for 20% of the qualitative assessment.
