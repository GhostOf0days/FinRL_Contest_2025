Team registration is done through the [TBD](). Please ensure that all team members provide their full names, emails, institutions, and the team name. We encourage you to use your institutional email to register.

The top 3 winners of each task should register the [conference](https://www.cloud-conf.net/datasec/2025/index.html) and present their work in person or online at the conference. At least one author of each accepted paper should register the [conference](https://www.cloud-conf.net/datasec/2025/index.html). Winners or papers with “No Show” may be redacted. Participants will be required to agree to this requirement at the time of submission.

## Submission
Please provide your HuggingFace/GitHub link for scripts and models in this [TBD](). Each team can submit multiple times and we will only use the latest version you submit. Your models and scripts should be accessible and runnable. 

Each team should submit short papers with 3 complimentary pages and up to 2 extra pages, including all figures, tables, and references. The paper submission is through the [FinRLFM special track](https://www.cloud-conf.net/datasec/2025/ids/FinRLFM.html) and should follow its instructions. 

## Rules
